1. biggest difference between git reset and git revert is 
that git reset will reset the state of the branch to a 
previous state by dropping all the changes post the desired 
commit while git revert will reset to a previous state by 
creating new reverting commits and keep the original commits.

2. Git Rebase
Streamlines a potentially complex history.
Avoids merge commit “noise” in busy repos with busy branches.
Cleans intermediate commits by making them a single commit, which can be helpful for DevOps teams.
Git Merge
Simple and familiar.
Preserves complete history and chronological order.
Maintains the context of the branch.

Git rebase and merge both integrate changes from one branch 
into another. Where they differ is how it's done. 
Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master. 
Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history.

3. git stash pop applies the top stashed element and removes it 
from the stack. git stash apply does the same, but leaves it 
in the stash stack.

4. Interactive rebasing can be used for changing commits in 
many ways such as editing, deleting, and squashing.
